# Metadata schema manager - documentation

In this directory you can find a few files with documentation. Note that there might be discrepancies between the docs and the actual implementation for newer features.

The files are present in Github-flavored Markdown and HTML:

- `architecture` describes the interaction between frontend and backend and the composition of the different files.
- `metadata-schemas` is a general tutorial on how to use the application
- `metadata-schemas-tech` provides a more technical description of the JSON format in which the schemas are created as well as their lifecycle.
